# Craftogether
Hi, welcome to Craftogether's *future* wiki !
Craftogether will be a place to collaborate on coding projects in languages like Scratch or HTML.
The work is in progress.
Here's a loading bar (off-topic) :

 website design|adding the GUI|coding the servers for collab|final redesign

 *As you see, I'm actually very far from the project's objective though, and I have to learn some coding languages like JS still ^^"*

 Find me on Scratch : @SCLF-Xingshu

 Note : as of 22 January 2026, Scratch have introduced new Terms of Service, stating that no automated bots/scripts are allowed. Therefore, I think that to use Craftogether, you should then upload your Scratch project, collaborate on Craftogether, then reuploading it into Scratch... which is ALSO forbidden because of the new ToS. Craftogether will be difficult to make :(
